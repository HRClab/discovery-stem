# Arduino Programming

In this lesson we will introduce some of the techniques for
programming small computers called *Arduinos*.

Arduinos are often used on small robots such as quadcopters, since
they are light-weight, easy-to-use, and fairly inexpensive.

We will program the Arduinos using the programming language C++. In
some other lessons, we will program with the language Python. Be
careful, because the two languages are a bit different. 


## Getting Started

We will start with a file that looks like this:

```
/* 
    This is an empty Arduino project file.
    
    In this lesson you will build up the code to perform some simple behaviors.
*/

/*
  This text is called a comment. It is ignored by the compiler.
  
  Comments are used to add explanations to code to make it easier for 
  people to understand.
*/

// Comments can also be written like this.

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```
