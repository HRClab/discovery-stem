# Sensors

In order to function, a robot must sense its physical location /
orientation, and apply physical actions to make the desired
movements.

In this lesson, we will learn about gyroscopes, which are used to
sense rotations in robots, mobile phones, and other fancy gizmos that
young people buy. 


# Connecting the gyroscope sensor to the Arduino

Attach the sensor to the breadboard.
